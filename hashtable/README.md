# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function. That makes accessing the data faster as the index value behaves as a key for the data value. In other words Hash table stores key-value pairs but the key is generated through a hashing function.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a Hashtable Class.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
